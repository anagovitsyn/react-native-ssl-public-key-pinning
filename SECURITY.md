## Reporting a Vulnerability

Instead of opening a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities, please go to the [Security](https://github.com/frw/react-native-ssl-public-key-pinning/security) tab on the GitHub repository to privately report a vulnerability, or send an email to open-source@frw.io to submit a report. Please write it up as you would a GitHub issue.
